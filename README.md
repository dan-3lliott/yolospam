# YOLOSPAM V1.0

## How to use YOLOSPAM
Install the Java Runtime Environment from https://java.com/en/download/

Launch the program from the command line by using `java -jar [path to yolospam.jar]`

By default, yolospam.jar can be found at yolospam/out/artifacts/yolospam_jar/yolospam.jar

When running the program for the first time, calibration (menu option 2) is recommended to ensure that the program will work correctly with your monitor dimensions.

Following calibration, spam (menu option 1) will allow you to spam the YOLO as intended.

After first-time calibration, make sure to exit the program from the main menu (menu option 3) to ensure that the data obtained from calibration is saved for future use.

YOLOSPAM is not intended to be a tool used for bullying or harassment. I do not condone this type of behavior.
